				<h2>Why noname.conf?</h2>
				<p>
					People dissatisfied about the state of certain FOSS conferences over the past
					few years haven't taken any real steps to change the situation. Many in the
					community are disgruntled with the status quo. But there hasn't been any action
					to change the situation.

				<h2>A true "community event"</h2>
				<p>
					Giving people what they want is just good business sense. It has nothing to do with the event being a "community event" or not. We wish to create a conference that is truly of, by and for the community.
				</p>
				<pre class="define">Community \Com*mu"ni*ty\, n.; pl. {Communities}. [L. communitas:
   cf. OF. communit['e]. Cf. {Commonalty}, and see {Common}.]
   1. Common possession or enjoyment; participation; as, a
      community of goods.
      [1913 Webster]</pre>
				<p>
					The key words here are <strong>possession</strong> and <strong>participation</strong>. It's not just about
attending the event but shaping it into the kind of event <strong><b>you</b></strong> want to
attend. Then, the <strong>enjoyment</strong> will come naturally.
				</p>
				<p>
					We plan to get the community involved in all aspects of the conference in a transparent manner. At the end of the day, people get the government^W conference they deserve!
				</p>
				
				
				<h2>The Team</h2>
				<p>
					The current team is mainly involved in setting up the website/backend needed to
					make community participation possible. We should have a usable site ready in a
					couple of days.
					The team will grow as the event takes shape and new members will be included
					based on specific skills they bring to the table.
				</p>
				<p>
					To paraphrase Neo... <br />
					<blockquote>We don't know the future. We didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. We came here to tell you how it's going to begin.<br />
						A conference where anything is possible. <br /> Where we go from there is a choice we
					leave to you. 
					</blockquote>
